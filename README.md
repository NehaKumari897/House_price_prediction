# House_price_prediction
A House Price Prediction model uses machine learning to estimate property values based on factors like location, size, rooms, age, and neighborhood. By analyzing past sales data, it predicts prices accurately for better buying, selling, and investment decisions

House Price Prediction Model
A comprehensive machine learning project that predicts house prices using multiple regression algorithms. The system analyzes 20+ features including bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, condition, and more to deliver accurate price predictions.
Key Features

Multiple ML Models: Compares Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks
Advanced Feature Engineering: Creates 15+ derived features including house age, renovation status, price per sqft, and premium property indicators
High Accuracy: Achieves 85%+ prediction accuracy with the best model
Comprehensive Visualizations: 20+ charts including price distributions, correlation heatmaps, feature importance, and prediction accuracy plots
Performance Metrics: Tracks R² score, RMSE, MAE, and percentage error across all models
Production Ready: Exports trained model, scaler, and feature configurations for deployment

Model Performance
The Random Forest model typically performs best with:

R² Score: ~0.87 (87% accuracy)
RMSE: ~$115,000
MAE: ~$80,000
60%+ of predictions within ±10% error
